        <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sean Maida!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I recently graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I built a strong 
            foundation in programming, data management, and problem-solving. My technical skill set includes Python, JavaScript,
            SQL, Microsoft Excel, and Power BI, and I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges. 
            <br>
            <br/>
            I am currently seeking a full-time software development or data analyst role where I can apply my technical skills
            and problem-solving mindset to create impactful solutions.
            <br/>
            <br>
            I enjoy watching baseball (go Yankees!), fishing, and hanging out with friends and family. I've always had an interest in technology, 
            but after taking a computer science course in high school, I became fascinated with building things from scratch which set me on the path of pursuing a career in computer science.
            My interest in analytics came through baseball where I'm interested in seeing the underlying metrics and stats behind a player.
